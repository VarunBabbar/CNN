# CNN
A customisable Convolutional Neural Network created from scratch. Work still in progress, but current features include:
1) Activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax
2) Operations possible: Conv2d, Conv3d, Maxpool, BatchNorm, Flatten, Fully Connected Layer
3) Backprop across all operations 
4) Max accuracy of 79% on MNIST with 3 layer conv_bn_relu architecture
5) Possible to customise architecture
